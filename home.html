      <h3>Our Current Bot</h3>

        <p>
          This is our early season robot and we are currently in the works of a
          full rebuild. We run 3.25 inch wheels at 360rpms with six motors
          making us very strong bot. We then run a two motor intake to insure we
          can load rings quickly and efficently. Our bot then has a two piston
          mobile goal clamp on the back of the robot that has served us very
          well this season. Our current bot is very simple but it's also
          extremly reliable. One of the more unquie features of our bot is our
          hammer system which allows us scoop the rings out of the corner but
          also to flip the goals over and then back up, this can be very
          helpfull in protecting our spare goals from the negitive corner.

      <h3>Awards</h3>
      <div class="flexStructure">
        <p>
          This year we have been to three tournaments so far and plan on going
          to more. Unfortantly due to our lack of wall stakes we haven't been
          able to win a tournament yet but we have managed to make it to finals
          which was a big achievemnent. We have won three different awards this
          season, being two excellent awards and one innovate award for our
          hammer system.
