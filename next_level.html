        <p>
          This year was really where our team started. Team Elements and really
          all the rest of our IQ years was made up by Carson, Ethan, and
          Griffin. We didn't know it when we started going into this season but,
          this season was our most sussfull season we have ever had in all of
          robotics.

        <p>
          While in all prevoius year we had built the vex IQ hero bot or the Vex
          IQ claw bot, this year we built our own bot all by ourselves. This was
          the first time we ever tried to come up with our own design, but we
          were extemely successfull. It was simple but very competitive in
          Arizona. We had a claw that could be used to stack and reach the
          yellow hubs, and we had two "mantis arms" which allowed us to drag up
          to four hubs across the feild at a time.

      <h3>The Season</h3>
      <div class="flexStructure">
        <p>
          This season was our best by far. By the end of it we ended up wining
          13 awards in Arizona which is still our top record for most awards in
          a season. We were extemely competitive and managed to win many
          tournaments. We ended the season by making it to the World
          Championship in Kentucky where we placed 13th in our divison.
